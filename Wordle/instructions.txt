Rules:
In the game of Wordle, you have six attempts at guessing a five-letter word. 
For every guess, you will be given a hint for each of the letters of your guess.
Each letter will be marked with one of the following symbols:

✔ - the letter is in the correct position
⚫ - the letter is in the word, but not in the correct position
❌ - the letter is not in the word at all

The game either ends after six tries or when you are able to guess the word. 

Notes: 
- If there is a duplicate letter in your guess, it will be marked as "⚫" if there is another occurence of the letter in the hidden word. 
Otherwise, it will be marked as "❌". 
- All the words used in this game, including your guesses, must be part of the word list.

Setup:
This game is played on a 5x6 grid. 
For each position in each row, there will be a symbol for the hint with the corresponding letter below.
If you have not guessed for the row yet, there will be a "⬛" for each position, representing an empty row.
